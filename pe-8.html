        <h3>History of RCTI</h3>
        <p>The institute is named after the Rai Bahadoor Ranchhodlal Chhotalal (The First Nagarpati and pioneer of textile industry in India). Ranchhodlal was one who bought textile revolution in India. He set up many textile mills in Ahmedabad which gave the city its moniker “Manchester of the East”. He has his great contribution in the field of education as he established many educational institutions in the city.

            The R C Technical Institute was established by Sir Chinubhai in memoir of his grandfather, Ranchhodlal in the year 1910 at Saraspur, Ahmedabad, which provided certificate programs at that time in various disciplines including textile spinning, electrical, mechanical, etc. Later in the year 1930, this institute was handed over to the then State Government of Bombay. Initially, the institute was running certificate programs in Mechanical, Electrical, Textile Spinning, Textile Weaving and Textile Processing. In the year 1947, these certificate programs were replaced by new Diploma programs in Textile Manufacturing and Textile Processing.
